# CodeQL queries to find API usages

This folder contains a CodeQL query that searches for additional examples of the deprecated/problematic usages for each library in the `libraries/<libname>/examples` folder. These QL queries can be run on set of checked out local repositories or through [Multi-repository variant analysis](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-mrva/).

See [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/) for more information.
